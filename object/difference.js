        What is different between the arrow function and regular function?

1. Syntax and Return Behavior

Arrow Function:

Syntax: let sum = (a, b) => a + b;
​
Explanation: Arrow functions provide a concise syntax. When the function consists of a single expression, the return statement is implicit; there's no need to use the return keyword. ​

Regular Function:

Syntax: ```javascript function sum(a, b) { return a + b; }

Explanation: Traditional functions require the use of the function keyword and explicitly include the return statement to output a value.
